# car_taxes

Car Taxes is a Flutter app meant for car owners. 
It helps you manage your car taxes and reminds you when the car's aid kit is about to expire and more
The diference between this app and others are the folowing:

1. You can add taxes how you like. There is no fixed amount of tax types.
This means you can have 7 types of taxes in France while someone in Sweden might have 5 (This is just a random example based on spontaneous thought not facts.
I do not know how many taxes the french or swedes pay per car)

2. The UI is simple and does not stand in your way. You can choose a theme in the settings.
